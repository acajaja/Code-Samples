To run this application you will need to put it on a web server (LAMP, MAMP, etc)
and navigation to run.php.

The menu defaults to a "user" menu, however, you can pass a "type" parameter in
the URL to generate other menus. Options are:

user | admin | super

Example:

http://somedomain.local/run.php
OR
http://somedomain.local/run.php?type=admin
